# PromptLinter

A PyTorch-powered linter for LLM prompts that analyzes prompt quality, scores hallucination risk, provides an explanatory visual trace, and suggests improvements.

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive system designed to provide a "pre-flight check" for Large Language Model (LLM) prompts. Before sending a prompt to an expensive or powerful LLM, this tool analyzes its quality and safety, providing actionable feedback to the user. This helps mitigate frustrating trial-and-error, reduces the risk of model hallucination, and guides users toward writing more effective prompts.
